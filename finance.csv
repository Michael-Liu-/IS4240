Praet: We have to use all instruments of monetary policy to ensure price stability across the euro area.,Finance
Praet: With inflation target of 0%  there would be no buffer. If an economic shock occurs in such cases  you have deflation straight away.,Finance
Praet: For good reasons  ECB defined price stability as inflation close to  but below  2% over medium term – with support of the Bundesbank.,Finance
Praet: If inflation would rise to 4%  all would expect ECB to do something about it. So  ECB also has to step in when inflation falls to 0,Finance

@beschuit_p Correct to a large extent. Draghi addresses this issue in his speech,Finance
Draghi: All this could only take place in the context of a decisive step towards closer Fiscal Union,Finance
Draghi: Would be natural over longer term to reflect further on how to always preserve ability to use fiscal policy counter-cyclically,Finance
Draghi: But no form of stronger governance can entirely remove the risk of self-fulfilling liquidity crises,Finance
Draghi: I welcome the Commission’s new proposal to stimulate investment spending in Europe,Finance
Draghi: Sound fiscal policy framework is necessary but it is not sufficient,Finance
Draghi: The importance of each country sticking to its commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact should therefore be beyond debate,Finance
Draghi: Sovereign debt must act as safe haven in times of econ. stress by a strong fiscal governance framework and by some form of backstop,Finance
Draghi: It is essential that national fiscal policies can perform their macroeconomic stabilisation role alongside monetary policy,Finance
Draghi: If we do not want a transfer union  then we have to be consistent and establish an environment where other mechanisms can work,Finance
Draghi: If we are to deepen private sector risk-sharing  we urgently need to address the barriers to capital market integration,Finance
Draghi: We need other ways to help spread short term costs. There is a particular onus on private risk-sharing to play this role.,Finance
Draghi: There is strong case for sovereignty over relevant econ. policies to be exercised jointly. That means above all structural reforms.,Finance
Draghi: During the crisis countries with more flexible economies have on the whole adjusted faster and with a lower employment cost,Finance
Draghi: Euro area countries need to invest more in other mechanisms to share the cost of shocks,Finance
Draghi: All euro area countries need to be able to thrive independently,Finance
Draghi: Euro is – and has to be – irrevocable in all Member States  not just b/o of Treaties  otherwise there cannot be a truly single money,Finance
Draghi: If there are parts of the euro area worse off inside the Union  doubts may grow about whether they might ultimately have to leave,Finance
Draghi: Member States have to be better off inside the union than they would be outside,Finance
Draghi: It is clear that  for all its resilience  our union is still incomplete,Finance
Draghi: If our union has proved more resilient than many thought  it is because those who doubted it misjudged the political dimension,Finance

Draghi: Challenge is to make collateral framework simpler and more transparent without impacting ability to access refinancing operations,Finance
Draghi: But relaxing eligibility criteria always coupled with a stricter counterparty framework and more stringent risk control measures,Finance
Draghi: Restricting banks' access to liquidity would increase the risk for the central bank’s balance sheet rather than protecting it,Finance
Draghi: Collateral framew. must never act pro-cyclically. Restricting banks’ access to liquidity in crisis could be risk to financial system,Finance

Draghi: A Capital Markets Union (CMU) improves funding to SMEs  enhances transmission of ECB’s monetary policy &amp; benefits economic growth,Finance
Draghi: However  monetary policy alone cannot overcome financial fragmentation in the euro area,Finance

@zfybo Actually  from Frankfurt and Washington,Finance
Draghi in Q&amp;A: our forward guidance differs from others in that it is qualitative. Harder to communicate initially; easier to get out at end,Finance
Draghi in Q&amp;A: we're moving towards a more active management of our balance sheet.,Finance
Draghi in Q&amp;A: when a central bank reaches lower bound on interest rates  size and composition of balance sheet is only remaining tool.,Finance
Draghi in Q&amp;A at Brookings: politics is not a constraint on our decision making... The ECB has been successful in shielding itself.,Finance
Draghi: Cannot see any way out of the crisis unless we create more confidence in the future potential of our economies,Finance
Draghi: All our efforts to support aggregate demand will be more effective if accompanied by policies to boost aggregate supply,Finance
Draghi: For governments and European institutions that have fiscal space  it makes sense to use it,Finance
Draghi: To now call into question not just the letter  but also the spirit of the fiscal governance framework would be self-defeating,Finance
Draghi: We are ready to alter size and/or composition of unconventional interventions as required,Finance
Draghi: These measures also fulfil broader objective: they allow us to continue to steer policy while interest rates are at lower bound,Finance
Draghi: ECB launched measures to make stance more expansionary &amp; add more stimulus. Most important is our package of credit easing measures,Finance
Draghi: As the banking sector is cleaned up  banks will have new capacity to lend  and our monetary policy will become even more effective,Finance
Draghi: Policies to repair the banking sector have to be accompanied by policies to develop capital markets,Finance
Draghi at Brookings Institution: Without reform  there can be no recovery. I am sceptical that reform is better achieved in good times.,Finance

MB Article 1: Further reductions in labour market rigidities would accelerate adjustment and reduce structural unemployment,Finance
MB Article 1: EA unemployment increases during the crisis in part reflect earlier structural imbalances and rigidities,Finance
MB Box 3: While financial factors improved  geopolitical risks and uncertainty about reforms may have reduced confidence,Finance
MB Box 3: Lower confidence for industrial and retail sectors and consumers behind the slowdown in economic activity,Finance
MB Box 2: Natural gas price declines are due to oil price developments  modest demand and convergence in wholesale markets,Finance
MB Box 2: Natural gas prices contributed to euro area disinflation. Outlook remains moderate despite supply chain risks,Finance
MB Box 1: Given the complementarity of the first two TLTROs  the two operations need to be assessed together,Finance

Draghi: With the monetary accommodation already in place  they will underpin a firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations,Finance
Draghi: They will reinforce fact of significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies,Finance
Draghi: Our asset purchases should ease the monetary policy stance more broadly and strengthen our forward guidance,Finance

Keynote address Mario Draghi at the Süddeutsche Zeitung Führungstreffen Wirtschaft 2013 ,Finance
Draghi: We encourage effective action by banks even before the comprehensive assessment is finished,Finance
Draghi: Restoring sustainable growth requires higher investment in human and physical capital  in all euro area countries.,Finance
Draghi: All the countries under strain are no longer accumulating external debt and “living beyond their means”,Finance
Draghi: The answer to the problems of the euro area is not to weaken its stronger but rather to strengthen its weaker economies.,Finance
Draghi: We are Europeans and we act for the euro area as a whole,Finance
Draghi: If we were to raise rates in this situation  it would only depress the economy further. And this would in turn affect savings.,Finance
Draghi: Interest rates are low because the economy is weak. Accommodative monetary policy is a response to this.,Finance
Draghi: The effect of monetary policy on the returns on savings cannot be seen in isolation.,Finance
Draghi: Our accommodative stance also has an important side effect: it facilitates the continuing internal rebalancing in the euro area.,Finance
Draghi: We did not act because of deflation risks  but to restore an appropriate safety margin from 0 as per our price stability objective.,Finance
Draghi: We have been witnessing a disinflation “in slow motion” for several months now,Finance
Draghi: Return of economic growth not a signal reform efforts are behind us  on the contrary. Determined action is more important than ever.,Finance
Draghi: Strong recovery involves national governments  social partners  business leaders and European actors all playing their part.,Finance

Draghi: There should be as little flexibility as possible as regards the resolution of 'gone concern' banks,Finance
Draghi: Our monetary policy remains accommodative for the foreseeable future  our exit remains distant,Finance
Draghi: True economic union means accepting decisions for the good of the euro area even if individual countries may disagree with them,Finance
